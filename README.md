# G-Code Streamer
This application is designed to stream a G-Code file to a serial port. 

## **Running the Application**

To run the base application, first build using:

`./build.sh`

This will produce an executable named `gcode-streamer` in the project directory.

Alternatively one can manually call:

`cargo build --release`

This will produce an executable in the following directory:

`<project-root>/target/release/gcode-streamer`

This executable may be copied and run from a seperate directory.

## **Using the Application**
This application makes use of the `clap` crate and the useful help messages generated by it.

To see the available options, run

`./gcode-streamer --help`

For more information about a particular subcommand run

`./gcode-streamer <SUBCOMMAND> --help`

### **Streaming**
The `stream` subcommand allows a user to stream an input G-Code file to a given output.

Syntax is as follows:

`./gcode-streamer stream --input <FILE> --port <PORT> --speed <SPEED>`

#### **Pre and Post Process**
The `stream` subcommand allows a user to optionally enter two additional G-Code files - one for pre-processing (will run prior to the main input file), and one for post-processing (will run after the main input file).

These are given to the `stream` sub command with the following two options:

`--pre <FILE>`

`--post <FILE>`
